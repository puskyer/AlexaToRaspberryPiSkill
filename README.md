# AlexaToRaspberryPiSkill
Alexa to RaspberryPI communication for both X10 and MQTT wip

Started from Controlling-Raspberry-Pi-using-Alexa (https://github.com/nishitpatel28/Controlling-Raspberry-Pi-using-Alexa)

The skill for Alexa will be made using Flask-Ask. For establishing connection we will be using ngrok. 
ngrok establishes a HTTP tunnel from Raspberry Pi to Alexa. 
The endpoint url will change every time ngrok is restarted, as an alternative you can use pagekite.
